Well, they are pretty unquestionably divine male beings, and the phrase suggests the translation \'sons of the gods.\' Some folks who insist that there can be no such things will call them \'angels,\' which strikes me as a theologically driven cop-out. The Hebrew language sometimes uses the phrase \'son(s) of\' to mean persons or beings belonging to the category of which they are \'sons.\' A \'son of the East,\' for instance, a description of Job in his book, certainly means something like \'an easterner.\' The assumption in this story seems to be that divine beings and human ones could interbreed, an idea the Greeks freely entertained. What are they doing in a monotheistic book? Well, they are marrying human women, that\u2019s what, and that suggests once again that the book may not be as monotheistic as we have been taught."
