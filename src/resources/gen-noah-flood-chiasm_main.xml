Alt. Trans.: "humankind" (Alter 38)</note>
    <note target="#a002">Heb.: beney ha'elohim = "sons of God" or "sons of the mighty" (Kass 157)
        
        Comment: "Who are those fellows? Well, they are pretty unquestionably divine male beings, and the phrase suggests the translation 'sons of the gods.' Some folks who insist that there can be no such things will call them 'angels,' which strikes me as a theologically driven cop-out. The Hebrew language sometimes uses the phrase 'son(s) of' to mean persons or beings belonging to the category of which they are 'sons.' A 'son of the East,' for instance, a description of Job in his book, certainly means something like 'an easterner.' The assumption in this story seems to be that divine beings and human ones could interbreed, an idea the Greeks freely entertained. What are they doing in a monotheistic book? Well, they are marrying human women, that’s what, and that suggests once again that the book may not be as monotheistic as we have been taught." (Good 67)</note>
    <note target="#a003">Heb.: tovoth = "fair" (Kass 156)
        
        Heb. Root: tov = "good," as used in Gen 3:6 (Kass 159)

        Comment: "God's speech is difficult to translate, much less to understand." (Kass 160)
        
        Comment: The verb is "a verb that appears nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible, and its meaning is not known. Dictionaries tend to say things like 'context suggests "remain,"' and it does, but I would rather leave a gap." (Good 67)</note>

Alt. Trans.: "giants" (Sacks 81)
        
        Comment: "The N e phîlîm turn up elsewhere, in Numbers 13.33, in a frightening report from some scouts sent by Moses into southern Canaan, the territory to which the Israelites were returning after the Exodus from Egypt. They report the N e phîlîm as gigantic people ('we looked to them like grasshoppers,' they say), with the result that no one wants to go into Canaan right there." (Good 68)</note>

        Alt. Trans.: "heroes" (Good 66)
        
        Alt. Trans.: "mighty men" ( Sacks 81)
        
        Comment: "Unlike the giants [Nephilim], these mighty men will not be met with again in Biblical literature. They are the so-called dead heroes of the past. The seventh line of the fifth column of the third tablet of the Gilgamesh [an ancient Babylonian epic] reads, 'My hand I will poise and will fell the cedars / A name that endures I will make for me.' Rather than simply denying Gilgamesh's existence, the Biblical author tries to show us what he was really like. His days were not the glorious days the poets sing of but the days of corruption which led to the Flood." (Sacks 82)</note>

    <note target="#a009">Comment: "The word we have translated as thoughts has the notion of that which plans or devises. The verse does not seem to refer to the whole of human thought, but only to that which concerns itself with changing the world by means of art, in order that man might fashion his own life rather than living according to the way set out for him."

    <note target="#a023">Comment: "The numbers 40 and 400 appear with amazing regularity in the Bible. Let us look at a few of the references to see if some order presents itself. Moses spent 40 days on the top of Mt. Sinai (Ex. 24:18). The Children of Israel, because of their sin, were forced to wander 40 years in the desert (Num. 14:33). Isaac was 40 years old when he married Rebekah (Gen. 25:20). The Children of Israel will spend 400 years in Egypt (Gen. 15:13). Abraham spent 400 shekels for the Cave of Machpelah (Gen. 23:15). The men who went out to spy on the new land were there for 40 days (Num. 13:25). The manna sustained the Children of Israel for 40 years (Ex. 16:35)." (Sacks 89)</note>
    <note target="#a024">Comment: "Th e hōm is the word I translated as 'abyss' in 1.2, over which darkness lay before the creation started [in Genesis Chapter 1]. It apparently means the cosmic area beneath Earth, and whether its 'fountains,' which burst open in Flood 2 [the account atrributed to the Priestly source], were thought to be connected to the waters of Sea is uncertain."

Comment: "[A]n actual verse of poetry, as one can see from its structure, rhythm, parallelism and the poetic words that it contains. Possibly the Torah quoted it in the exact form in which it was found in the ancient Israelite poetry on the Deluge." (Cassuto, Part Two 84)
Comment: "This line of poetry has been cited by Umberto Cassuto and others as a fragment from an old epic poem on the Flood. This is by no means a necessary assumption, however, because it is a regular practice of biblical narrative to introduce insets of verse at moments of high importance, and in many instances the composition of verse and prose may be by the same hand." (Alter 44)</note>

    <note target="#a028">Citing Nils Wilhelm Lund's book Chiasmus in the New Testament, Kikawada and Quinn claim the previous three verses form a chiasmus:

    <note target="#a029">Heb.: ruah = "wind" or "spirit" (Cassuto, Part Two 101)
        Comment: "Just as God's ruah was hovering over the face of the waters at the beginning of the world's creation [in Genesis Chapter 1], when the waters of the deep covered the earth, so now that the waters again submerged the earth, God made a ruah pass over them." (Cassuto, Part Two 101) </note>
    <note target="#a030">Comment: "[O]ne small clue gives the reader pause: Noah's first scout for dry land was the raven. Remembering the raven's carnivorousness, Noah must have hoped the bird would return with rotting flesh but the ravenous scout 'went to and fro until the waters were dried up from the earth.'" (Kass 170)
Comment: "This bird, which as it were stands guard over the world, has a double significance in the Bible. According to the Laws of Leviticus it is an abominable bird not to be touched by Israel, and yet when Elijah was forced to leave mankind and live in the desert the ravens fed him in accordance with God's command (I Kings 17:4,6)." (Sacks 93)</note>
    <note target="#a031">Comment: "Unlike the raven, the dove is a clean bird which may be used as a sacrifice (Lev. 5:7). It returns to the Ark because its place is with man. Unlike the raven, the dove was not at home in the chaos of the Flood..." (Sacks 93-94)</note>
    <note target="#a032">Comment: "The word for 'fragrance' (or perhaps, something pleasing or soothing), nihoah, is always attached to 'odor' as a technical term linked with sacrifices, and it probably puns here on the name Noah." (Alter 48)</note>

    <note target="#a036"><!-- Comment by Chris. -->
        Comment: "Prior to the Flood man had a natural kinship with the animals; but with the rise of the political bond, that kinship was broken. A similar account is given in the Gilgamesh but from a very different point of view. [. . .] In the Biblical account things go the other way around. It is man who rejects the animals by accepting them as food. The particular care of man for man which political life requires precludes the unity of all living beings characteristic of earlier times. The problem which the text poses at this point is to determine why the injunction to establish courts of law for the prohibition of murder should be accompanied by the permission to eat meat. This permission was granted in the strongest possible terms [. . .] Any haziness in the distinction between animals and man which had allowed for their kinship was to be forgotten." (Sacks 96)</note>

    <note target="#a038">Comment: "literally, 'its soul'" (Cassuto, Part Two 126)
        Comment: "The word that I have translated 'life force,' nepheš, is sometimes translated 'soul,' but that is a confusion between Hebrew and Greek. Greek knows of a 'soul,' a psychē, but it is a different principle entirely. In Genesis 2, when the man is formed out of dust, and Yahweh breathes breath into his nose, he becomes a 'living being,' as I translated it there: a nepheš chayyah, a somewhat redundant way of saying a nepheš, really alive. That expression has traditionally been translated “a living soul.” But it’s not like the Greek soul, which was apparently in some respects thought to be indestructible. Part of what is being commanded in 9.4 is not to eat living animals, and that was expanded at some point to require that meat was edible under Jewish law only if the blood had been drained out. That is part of what is meant even today by 'kosher' meat." (Good 84-85)</note>
    <note target="#a039">Heb.: shofekh dam ha'adam damo yishafekh (Kass 181)
        Alt. Trans. "Who sheds the blood of the man, / by the man his blood will be shed." (Good 85)
Alt. Trans.: “Sheds blood of man by man his blood will be shed.” (Kass 181)
        Comment: "The language of the Hebrew text... makes the point beautifully, through word repetition and inverted word order. In the mirrored (chiastic) structure -- abccba" (Kass 182-83).

    <note target="#a040"><!-- Comment by Cassandra. -->
Comment: "This is the first instance of a common convention of biblical narrative: when a speaker addresses someone and the formula for introducing speech is repeated with no intervening response from the interlocutor, it generally indicates some sort of significant silence -- a failure to comprehend, a resistance to the speaker's words, and so forth." (Alter 51)</note>
    <note target="#a041">Comment: "All covenants require a sign since all covenants must be remembered. Their being is in their being remembered because they lack sufficient natural foundation. Memory is such an integral part of a covenant that even God must have a sign, because without a sign there is no covenant." (Sacks 97)</note>

    <note target="#a047">Comment: "In the ancient East Mediterranean world wine was something more than a beverage gladdening the heart. For the Greeks wine, fire, and phallus formed a triad denoting sexuality. [...] The biblical Song of Songs reveals this same interrelation of wine, fire, and sex. [...] Wine gave power to lovers, heightening their desire and enhancing their vigor for lovemaking. [...] The special powers ascribed to wine and other intoxicants require a drastic revision in popular opinion of Noah: in all likelihood his intoxication did not stem from any deficiency of character but from his wholehearted attempt to execute the command he received from God [to repopulate the earth] upon disembarking from the ark." (Cohen 3-7)</note>
    <note target="#a048">Comment: "In fact, 'his tent' is a questionable translation; the noun has an ending that suggests 'her tent.' Hence rabbinic scholars have interpreted the passage as referring to the tent of Noah's wife." (Kikawada and Quinn 102)</note>
    <note target="#a049">Comment: "No one has ever figured out exactly what it is that Ham does to Noah. Some, as early as the classical Midrash, have glimpsed here a Zeus-Chronos story in which the son castrates the father or, alternately, penetrates him sexually. The latter possibility is reinforced by the fact that 'to see the nakednes of' frequently means 'to copulate with.'" (Alter 52-53)
        Comment: "Ham perhaps sees his father and mother in an act of intercourse, or at least attempted intercourse. [. . .] One answer suggests itself. Ham commits incest with his mother after his father is rendered incapacitated by drink (and after Noah arouses the mother but proves incapable of satisfying her). Ham supplants his father, much as the sons of God before supplanted other potential human fathers. " (Kikawada and Quinn 102-3)
        Comment: "The origins of the whole must be stated in some form, but they must also be forgotten. From the Biblical point of view they may not be hearkened back to either as a paradigm or as a way of understanding. The temporal beginnings must be superseded by the Covenant. [. . .] When Ham looked upon his father's nakedness he implicitly rejected the New Way insofar as that Way was essentially new. Either by design or by accident he gazed upon those origins which lie in back of the Covenant." (Sacks 98)</note>
